and a bit about me.

Well got into photography in the late 70's when I was a kid. Got into fashion photography when I was a sophomore. Went to a 2yr college for commercal photography... Did a number of shoots from then on. I got into web design in the mid 90's with a simple site to promote my photography talent. I took a certificate program in the mid 2000's for what was called web design at the time although I had gotten my feet wet with some web development as well.
